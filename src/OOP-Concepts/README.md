# Object-oriented programming (OOP) JavaScript

## OOP Principles

1. **Abstraction** - states that classes include only the details relevant to their context.
   Doing so creates abstract classes, which more specific classes and objects can extend.

2. **Encapsulation** - ensures that objects are self-contained and limits what information about their state they expose.
   In other words, other objects cannot directly access the state of an object. Each object manages its own state.
   To modify an object’s state, other objects need to use that object’s dedicated methods.
   This principle generally makes a clear division between its public interface and its private internal state.

3. **Inheritance** - declares that objects get some or all of the properties of their parents.
   Inheritance is the foundation of reusability in OOP. With it, you can create a class and its properties can be reused in multiple objects.
   Inheritance lets programmers express the idea that some objects in a system are more specialized versions of other objects.

4. **Polymorphism** - states that each sub class can be used in the same way as its parent class or parent classes.
   At the same time, each sub class may keep its own, distinct form of attributes and methods initially defined in a super class.
   (when a method has the same name but a different implementation)
